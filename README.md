You'll see the latest stable version available for download.

b). Choose the Download Option:Under the Download for Windows section, click the button that corresponds to your system architecture (32-bit or 64-bit). In most cases, you'll want the 64-bit version unless you're using a specific older system.

c). Run the Installer:Once the download is complete, locate the downloaded file (usually named VSCodeUserSetup-{version}.exe).
Double-click the downloaded file to launch the installer.

d). Follow the Installation Wizard:The VS Code installer will guide you through the setup process. By default, it will choose the recommended settings, which are generally good for most users.
You can optionally click on the Options button to customize the installation location (default: C:\Users\{Username}\AppData\Local\Programs\Microsoft VS Code).

e). Complete the Installation:Click the Install button to begin the installation process.The installer will download additional components and set up VS Code on your system.

f). Launch VS Code (Optional):Once the installation is complete, you'll be presented with the option to launch VS Code directly. You can choose to launch it now or open it later.
Additionally ,you can create a desktop shortcut for VS Code during the installation process (recommended for easy access).After the initial launch, VS Code might download some additional extensions or updates depending on your settings.You can access VS Code features and settings from the menu bar within the application window.
With this you will have  successfully downloaded and installed Visual Studio Code on your Windows 11 system.


2. First-time Setup:
   - After installing VS Code, what initial configurations and settings should be adjusted for an optimal coding environment? Mention any important settings or extensions.
